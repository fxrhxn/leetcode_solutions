21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Easy
Topics: Linked List, Recursion

This problem involves merging two sorted linked lists, list1 and list2, into one sorted list. The task is to splice together the nodes from both lists to create a new linked list that maintains the sorted order.

Example:

Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
Key Constraints:

Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
Each list contains between 0 and 50 nodes.
Node values are between -100 and 100.
