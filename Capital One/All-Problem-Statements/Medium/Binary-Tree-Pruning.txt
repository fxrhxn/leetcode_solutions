Binary Tree Pruning
Medium
Topics: Tree, Depth-First Search

Given the root of a binary tree, your goal is to return the same tree after removing every subtree that does not contain a 1. A subtree consists of a node and all of its descendants.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
Explanation: Only the nodes that form subtrees containing at least one 1 are retained.

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,0,1,0,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,1,null,1]

Example 3:
Input: root = [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0]
Output: [1,1,0,1,1,null,1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 200].
Node values are either 0 or 1.
