Here’s a blurb for the Odd Even Linked List problem:

328. Odd Even Linked List
Medium
Topics: Linked List, Two Pointers

Given the head of a singly linked list, rearrange the nodes so that all nodes with odd indices are grouped together, followed by nodes with even indices. The first node is considered odd, the second node is even, and so on. The relative order of nodes within both the odd and even groups must remain the same as in the input.

You must solve this in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]

Example 2:
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [0, 10⁴].
Node values are between -10⁶ and 10⁶.
