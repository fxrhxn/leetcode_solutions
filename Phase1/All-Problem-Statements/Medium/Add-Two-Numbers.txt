Add Two Numbers
Medium
Topics: Linked List, Math

You are given two non-empty linked lists that represent two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, with each node containing a single digit. Your task is to add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list, where each node contains one digit of the result.

You can assume the two numbers don't have any leading zeroes, except if the number is exactly 0.

Example 1:
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 3:
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is between [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
The input numbers do not contain leading zeros, except the number 0 itself.
