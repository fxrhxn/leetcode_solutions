Remove Linked List Elements
Easy
Topics: Linked List

Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, your task is to remove all nodes from the linked list that contain the value val, and return the new head of the modified list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
1 <= Node.val <= 50
0 <= val <= 50
