98. Validate Binary Search Tree
Medium
Topics: Binary Tree, Depth-First Search

The problem asks to determine if a given binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST). A valid BST follows these rules:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
The right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
Both left and right subtrees must also be valid binary search trees.
Example:

Input: root = [2,1,3]

Output: true

Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]

Output: false

Key Constraints:

The number of nodes is between 1 and 10,000.
Node values are between -2^31 and 2^31 - 1.
