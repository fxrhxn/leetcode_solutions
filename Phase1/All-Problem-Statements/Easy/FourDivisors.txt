1390. Four Divisors
Medium
Topics: Math, Array

The task is to find the sum of divisors for integers in a given array that have exactly four divisors. If no integers meet this criterion, return 0.

Example:

Input: nums = [21,4,7]

Output: 32
Explanation: The integer 21 has four divisors: 1, 3, 7, and 21. The other numbers do not have four divisors, so only the divisors of 21 contribute to the sum.

Input: nums = [21,21]

Output: 64
Explanation: Both instances of 21 contribute their divisors, resulting in a total sum of 64.

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: 0
Explanation: None of these integers have exactly four divisors.

Constraints:

The length of nums ranges from 1 to 10,000.
Each integer in nums is between 1 and 100,000.
